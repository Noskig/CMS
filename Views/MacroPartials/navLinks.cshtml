    This snippet makes a list of links to the of parents of the current page using an unordered HTML list.

    How it works:
    - It uses the Ancestors() method to get all parents and then generates links so the visitor can go back
    - Finally it outputs the name of the current page (without a link)
*@

@{  var selection = Model.Content.Ancestors().ToArray(); 
    var currentpage = UmbracoContext.PublishedRequest.PublishedContent.Name.ToString();
}


@if (selection.Length > 0)
{
        @* For each page in the ancestors collection which have been ordered by Level (so we start with the highest top node first) *@
        @foreach (var item in selection.OrderBy(x => x.Level))
        {
        <li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link" href="@item.Url(PublishedUrlProvider)" style="text-decoration: none;">@item.Name</a></li>
        }

}
